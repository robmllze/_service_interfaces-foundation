# Service Interfaces Module (Front-End)

## About

The [Foundation](https://github.com/robmllze/foundation) template is divided into several modules. This helps separate concerns and makes it easier to manage the codebase.

This is the Foundation's Service Interfaces Module. It plays a crucial role in defining the communication and data exchange patterns within the app.

It comprises of the following:

- **External APIs**: A collection of external REST invokers.
- **Functions**: A collection of cloud function invokers.
- **Helper Interfaces**: A collection of interfaces designed to help with the implementation of the app's core features.
- **Interfaces**: A collection of abstract interfaces that contribute to the app's structural framework.

## Notes

- Rename `_service_interfaces-foundation` to `_service_interfaces` before using it in your project.
